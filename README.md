Network Configuration and Troubleshooting Project
This project focuses on designing, configuring, and troubleshooting a comprehensive network infrastructure using Cisco Packet Tracer. It covers various aspects such as Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) configuration, switching, routing, VoIP implementation, IoT device integration, DNS server setup, email server configuration, and network issue resolution.

Project Objective
The primary objective of this project is to create a robust and interconnected network environment that supports seamless communication, collaboration, and efficient network operations. By integrating multiple network components and services, we aim to demonstrate expertise in network design, configuration, and troubleshooting.

Features and Components
The project includes the following features and components:

WLC Configuration: Configuring the Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) to provide reliable and secure wireless connectivity for network devices.
Switching Configuration: Implementing network switches to create an efficient and scalable local area network (LAN).
Routing Configuration: Configuring routing protocols to ensure proper communication between different network segments.
VoIP Implementation: Setting up Voice over IP (VoIP) services to enable voice communication over the network.
IoT Device Integration: Integrating Internet of Things (IoT) devices into the network infrastructure for data collection and monitoring.
DNS Server Setup: Establishing a Domain Name System (DNS) server to enable hostname resolution within the network.
Email Server Configuration: Configuring an email server to facilitate email communication within the network.
Troubleshooting: Applying effective troubleshooting methodologies to identify and resolve network issues, ensuring optimal network performance and reliability.
